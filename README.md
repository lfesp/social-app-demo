# Lesson 8

## Goal 

The goal of this lesson is to add functionality to like/unlike a flutter. We should be able to display how many total likes a flutter has, and if the current user has liked the flutter.

> Be sure to switch to the `8-lesson` branch in your local environment.

## Task 1: Add `like` API endpoint

You will find a new starter file for the **like** endpoint: `pages/api/flutter/like/index.js`.

This route should only update the likes field of a flutter.

The request body will contain the flutter `_id`, `userId`, and `action`.

`action` will be the update operator that will be used. When a flutter is liked, the operator will be `$addToSet`. When a flutter is unliked, the operator will be `$pull`.

```js
case "PUT":
  const updateData = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/updateOne`, {
    ...fetchOptions,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      ...fetchBody,
      filter: { _id: { "$oid": req.body._id } },
      update: { [req.body.action]: {
        likes: req.body.userId,
      } },
    }),
  });
  const updateDataJson = await updateData.json();
  res.status(200).json(updateDataJson);
  break;
```
</details>

## Task 2: Update App Services Rule

1. From your Data API App Services app, navigate to the **Rules** tab.
1. Select the `flutters` collection.
1. Switch to the **Advanced View**.
1. Click the **Convert to Advanced View** button.
1. Type "convert" then click the **Convert** button.
1. Edit the `readAll` rule to allow writes to the `likes` field and change the name to `non-owner`.
    ```js
    {
      "name": "non-owner",
      "apply_when": {},
      "read": true,
      "fields": {
        "likes": { "write": true }
      },
      "insert": false,
      "delete": false,
      "search": true
    }
    ```
1. Click the **Save** button in the top right.

## Task 3: Test 

Test your application. If it is not already running, from the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and test liking and unliking flutters. You should be able to like/unlike any flutter, including those you have not created.
